This tool will/might stop working after 01-jan-2040, as the myDrivers.cer will expire on that day, so will have to update the certificates before that to avoid breaking this Tool
Refer this to create new certificate with very long lasting validity:

Or generate certificate on the fly by adding appropriate logic in unsigned_driver_installer.bat
